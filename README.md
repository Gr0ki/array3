This is a training console project.

Here main.py is a main file of a project, where all the modules (TK_1.py - TK-5.py) was included.
The functions  to process a list in a different ways was taken from included modules.

Then results were printed in a table, which was created by using "prettyttable" library.
So before running a program you need to install depending library using command "pip install prettyttable".


Here some example how the program works:

Enter length of a list: 5
Enter an integer value: 1
Enter an integer value: 2
Enter an integer value: 3
Enter an integer value: 4
Enter an integer value: 5
+------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+
| Processing operations over a list                                | Results                     |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+
| Minimum and maximum values in the data list                      | 1, 5                        |
| Each element of the list divided by average value of the list    | 0.33, 0.67, 1.0, 1.33, 1.67 |
| Each element of the list multiplied by average value of the list | 3.0, 6.0, 9.0, 12.0, 15.0   |
| Square root of each element in the list                          | 1.0, 1.41, 1.73, 2.0, 2.24  |
